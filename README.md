## Introduction

This project looks at data from the U.S. General Survey surrounding Jewish life and identity in the United States throughout 1988 to 2021. The purpose of this project is to understand how, in a time of increased antisemitic sentiment in the mainstream, Jewish respondents to the survey are responding to questsions about their identity, Jewish affiliations, upbringing, and lifestyles. 


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis, including the raw data extracted from the U.S. General Survey website.
-   `outputs` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper.
